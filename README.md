Then add the number of players and their names.
You can choose a certain player to be an AI by writing 'ai' after the name (e.g. Mark ai).

After setting the game, use the following commands: To roll the dices and then continue your move write 'roll', to stop your move - 'stop'. There are helful messages and notes in the gameplay that help you decide which command to use.

Note that if you have rolled ðŸ‘£ on some dices they will be included in your next roll if you decide to continue your move by using the command 'roll'. The dices to roll will again be 3 as dices from the dice cup will be added if necessary.

If there are less than 3 dices in the dice cup, it will be refilled. The player which has the most brains and those brains are >= 13 wins. If there are two or more players with the same result, the player who first reached the number of brains wins.
